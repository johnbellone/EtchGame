# Etch Game
A simple example game using node-webkit, coffeescript and LESS.

# How to run
This project requires [node-webkit][nw] which is used as a Webkit shim. But in reality it should be able
to run in anything (including a browser). But you get all the Chromium goodies for free: WebGL, SVG, 
WebM, etc.

Just execute:
`node-webkit src`
